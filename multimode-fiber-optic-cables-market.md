<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Multimode Fiber Optic Cables Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Step Index</li><li>Gradient Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Multimode fiber optic cables are classified into two main types based on the way light travels through the core: Step Index and Gradient Index. Step Index cables have a core with a uniform refractive index, causing light rays to travel in a straight line. Gradient Index cables have a core with a varying refractive index, allowing light rays to follow a curved path. While Step Index cables are simpler and cheaper, Gradient Index cables offer higher bandwidth and reduced dispersion, making them more suitable for high-speed data transmission.</p></p>
