<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Steel Sheet Piling Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hot Rolled Steel Sheet Piles</li><li>Cold-formed steel sheet pile</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Steel sheet piling is used in construction projects to create a barrier against soil and water. Hot rolled steel sheet piles are produced by heating steel to high temperatures and rolling it into shape. They are strong and durable, making them ideal for deep foundations. Cold-formed steel sheet piles, on the other hand, are created by bending steel sheets without heating them. They are cheaper to produce and are suitable for lighter construction projects or temporary barriers. Both types have their own advantages and are utilized in different construction applications.</p></p>
