<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric AC Motors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Synchronous</li><li>Induction</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electric AC Motors are commonly categorized into two main types based on their operating principles: synchronous motors and induction motors. Synchronous motors operate at a constant speed determined by the frequency of the AC power supply, making them ideal for applications requiring precise speed control. On the other hand, induction motors operate at a speed slightly lower than the synchronous speed, making them better suited for high-torque applications. Both types of motors are widely used in various industrial and commercial sectors due to their efficiency, reliability, and versatility.</p></p>
