<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The EMG Biosensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Surface Biosensors</li><li>Intramuscular Biosensors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>EMG biosensors are used to monitor and record electrical activity in muscles. There are two main types of EMG biosensors - surface biosensors and intramuscular biosensors. Surface biosensors are placed on the skin surface and are non-invasive, making them more comfortable for the user. Conversely, intramuscular biosensors are inserted directly into the muscle tissue for more precise measurements. Both types of biosensors are important tools in various fields such as sports science, rehabilitation, and biofeedback therapy.</p></p>
