<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flexible Firestop Sealant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Elastomeric Type</li><li>Intumescent Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flexible Firestop Sealant is categorized into two main types: Elastomeric Type and Intumescent Type. Elastomeric Type sealants have a flexible consistency that allows them to stretch and move with the building materials, providing a durable seal against fire and smoke. Intumescent Type sealants, on the other hand, expand when exposed to high temperatures, forming a protective char that helps contain the spread of fire. Both types are crucial for ensuring the safety of buildings and occupants during a fire emergency.</p></p>
