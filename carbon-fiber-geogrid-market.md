<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carbon Fiber Geogrid Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Biaxial Geogrids</li><li>Uniaxial Geogrids</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Carbon fiber geogrids are commonly classified into two main types: biaxial geogrids and uniaxial geogrids. Biaxial geogrids have strong tensile strength in both principal directions, making them ideal for stabilizing materials in two dimensions. On the other hand, uniaxial geogrids have high tensile strength in one direction, providing excellent reinforcement for materials that experience mainly one-directional stress. Both types of carbon fiber geogrids are widely used in construction, infrastructure, and environmental projects for enhancing soil stability and preventing soil erosion.</p></p>
