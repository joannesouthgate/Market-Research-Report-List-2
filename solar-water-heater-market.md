<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Water Heater Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pressurized Solar Water Heater</li><li>Non Pressure Solar Water Heater</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Solar water heaters come in two main types- pressurized and non-pressurized. Pressurized solar water heaters use a pump to circulate water through the system, providing consistent pressure and hot water even on overcast days. Non-pressurized solar water heaters rely on natural convection to circulate water, making them a simpler and more cost-effective option. Both types offer energy-efficient solutions for heating water using solar power, reducing reliance on traditional energy sources and lowering utility bills.</p></p>
