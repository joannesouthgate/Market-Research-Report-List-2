<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sound Barrier Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reflective</li><li>Absorptive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Reflective sound barrier systems are designed to reflect sound waves away from a particular area, preventing noise from entering or escaping. These barriers typically consist of hard, smooth materials that bounce sound waves back in the direction they came from. On the other hand, absorptive sound barrier systems are designed to absorb sound waves, reducing their intensity. These barriers are made of porous materials that dampen sound vibrations and prevent them from transmitting through the barrier. Both types of sound barrier systems have their own advantages and applications in various industries.</p></p>
