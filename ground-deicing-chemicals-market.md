<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ground Deicing Chemicals Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid</li><li>Solid</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Ground Deicing Chemicals market involves two main types of deicing agents: liquid and solid. Liquid deicing chemicals are typically used for pre-treatment and quick removal of ice and snow on aircraft surfaces. They are effective in melting ice at a faster rate than solid deicers. Solid deicing chemicals, on the other hand, are preferred for longer-lasting protection and can be applied as pellets or granules. Both types of deicing agents play a crucial role in ensuring safe take-offs and landings during winter conditions.</p></p>
