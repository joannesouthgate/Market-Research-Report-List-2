<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cathode Binder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water Based Type</li><li>Solvent Based Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cathode binder market can be classified into two types, water-based and solvent-based. Water-based binders are environmentally friendly and less toxic compared to solvent-based binders. They are mainly used in the production of lithium-ion batteries and are less flammable. Solvent-based binders, on the other hand, are more commonly used in the production of traditional batteries. They provide better adhesion and flexibility but are considered more hazardous and not as eco-friendly as water-based binders. Both types play a crucial role in the cathode manufacturing process.</p></p>
