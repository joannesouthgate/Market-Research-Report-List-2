<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial X-ray Film Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Screen Type Films</li><li>Non-Screen Type Films</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Industrial X-ray film is available in two main types: Screen Type Films and Non-Screen Type Films. Screen Type Films are designed to work in conjunction with intensifying screens to amplify the X-ray image, providing higher sensitivity and faster image acquisition. On the other hand, Non-Screen Type Films do not require intensifying screens and are directly exposed to X-rays, offering higher image resolution and contrast. Both types cater to different industrial applications depending on the desired image quality and sensitivity requirements.</p></p>
