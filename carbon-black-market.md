<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carbon Black Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermal Black</li><li>Furnace Black</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Carbon black is commonly classified into two main types - Thermal Black and Furnace Black. Thermal Black is produced by decomposing natural gas or other hydrocarbons in a controlled combustion process. It is characterized by its small particle size and high purity, making it suitable for applications requiring high conductivity and chemical resistance. On the other hand, Furnace Black is produced by burning heavy aromatic oils or coal tar. It has a larger particle size and lower purity, making it ideal for applications that require reinforcement and coloring properties.</p></p>
