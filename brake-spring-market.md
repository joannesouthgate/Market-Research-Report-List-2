<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Brake Spring Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Progressive Spring</li><li>Linear Spring</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Brake spring markets are typically categorized into two main types: progressive spring and linear spring. Progressive springs gradually increase resistance as they are compressed, providing a more controlled braking experience. In contrast, linear springs offer consistent resistance throughout their compression. Both types of springs are commonly used in brake systems to help regulate the amount of force applied when braking, but the choice between progressive and linear springs ultimately depends on the specific requirements of the braking application.</p></p>
