<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Handheld 3D Scanner Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Laser</li><li>Structure Light</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Industrial Handheld 3D Scanners are typically classified into two main types: Laser and Structure Light scanners. Laser scanners use laser technology to capture precise 3D measurements of objects by emitting laser beams and analyzing the reflections. Structure Light scanners, on the other hand, project light patterns onto the object and create a 3D model based on the distortion of these patterns. Both types of scanners are widely used in industries such as manufacturing, automotive, aerospace, and healthcare for tasks like quality control, reverse engineering, and prototyping.</p></p>
